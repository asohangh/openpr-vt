Instructions for building and running OpenPR:
cd src/
# setup boost env variables for TORC, these locations work for Ubuntu 13.10
export BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/boost
export BOOST_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib
make
sudo bash
# if you want to install, it is not necessary
export BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/boost
export BOOST_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib
make install

I got some errors building TORC with Ubuntu 13.10 with g++ 4.8.1, there is
a patch to disable the -Werror flag called torc.patch, apply it if you get
errors about unused local typedefs.

To build the example designs:
cd res/counter/sandbox/
# source Xilinx script from wherever you installed it
source $(XILINX_DIR)/xilinx64.sh 
# don't use Xilinx's ancient libraries
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# Tell the makefile where to find TORC device files if you ran make install
export TORC=/usr/local/share/openpr
# or if you didn't run make install you can tell the Makefile where the anticore executable resides
# it will figure out the database directory automatically
export PATH={Path to openpr repo}/src/:$PATH
# build sandbox
make
cd ../increment
# build increment counter
make partial
cd ../decrement
# build increment counter
make partial
